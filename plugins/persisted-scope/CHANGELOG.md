# Changelog

## \[2.0.0-alpha.1]

- [`d5a7c77`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/d5a7c77a8d0e7912a6b07b22ed329004edd6e80b)([#545](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/545)) Fixes docs.rs build by enabling the `tauri/dox` feature flag.
- [`aba07c2`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/aba07c27b887c1cc54026024227cb3f74c91e21a)([#468](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/468)) Split up fs and asset scopes. **This will reset the asset protocol scope once!**
- [`aba07c2`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/aba07c27b887c1cc54026024227cb3f74c91e21a)([#468](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/468)) Fix usage of directory patterns by removing glob asterisks at the end before allowing/forbidding them. This was causing them to be escaped, and so undesirable paths were allowed/forbidden while polluting the `.persisted-scope` file.

### Dependencies

- Upgraded to `fs@2.0.0-alpha.1`

## \[2.0.0-alpha.0]

- [`ebb2eb2`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/ebb2eb2fe2ebfbb70530d16a983d396aa5829aa1)([#274](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/274)) Recursively unescape saved patterns before allowing/forbidding them. This effectively prevents `.persisted-scope` files from blowing up, which caused Out-Of-Memory issues, while automatically fixing existing broken files seamlessly.
- [`717ae67`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/717ae670978feb4492fac1f295998b93f2b9347f)([#371](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/371)) First v2 alpha release!

## \[0.1.1]
