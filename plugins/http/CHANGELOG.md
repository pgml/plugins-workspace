# Changelog

## \[2.0.0-alpha.1]

- [`7d9df72`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/7d9df7297a221a64d9de945ffc2cd8313d3104dc)([#428](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/428)) Multipart requests are now handled in JavaScript by the `Request` JavaScript class so you just need to use a `FormData` body and not set the content-type header to `multipart/form-data`. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requests must be done manually.

The new `fetch` method tries to be as close and compliant to the `fetch` Web API as possible.
